## Reflection Questions

### 1. What did you do in this lab?
_This lab was a guided exercise in learning to connect cables and begin exploring terminal configuration for a router._

### 2. What did you learn?
_I learned about how to use packet tracer. This included exercises in switching back and forth between the logical and physical displays, connecting cables, and configuring a router with a terminal connection._

### 3. What did you struggle with or not fully understand?
_I had a couple issues learning the command line, there was a little confusion with how it showed "end with ctrl+Z". I thought it was end a command with ctrl+Z and not that ends the privileged mode._

### 4. What suggestions do you have to improve this lab experience?
_This lab wasn't bad. Maybe the CLI instructions for the terminal could be a little more clear with how it operates._
