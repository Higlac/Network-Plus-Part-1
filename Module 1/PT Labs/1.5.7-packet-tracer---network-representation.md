## Reflection Questions

### 1. What did you do in this lab?
_There wasn't a lot to do in this lab. The only interaction with network building tools was to add one end device and an intermediary device before being asked to construct a larger network._

### 2. What did you learn?
_I honestly don't know. I answered a handful of questions that were review from the network essentials class, but those questions aren't being turned in, then constructed a network with no real direction or configuration._

### 3. What did you struggle with or not fully understand?
_I didn't know if this was a written assignment or a practical lab._

### 4. What suggestions do you have to improve this lab experience?
_More direction on what the purpose of a lab is, and what I'm being graded on. The first lab was very straight forward compared to what this was wanting. I much prefer having instructions on what is required rather than just being set loose and not knowing what to do._
