# Networking Careers in the Cloud and AI Era
***

## Welcome to Network+ Part 1

To kick off our journey into the world of networking, let's explore how the field has evolved and where it's headed. This assignment will help you get a feel for the kinds of jobs available today, how networks are built and managed, and how cloud computing and AI are reshaping the landscape.

## Your Task

Use Google or another search engine to explore the following questions. Take notes and write a short summary of what you discover.

### Research Questions

1. **What kinds of networking jobs exist today?**  
   Look into roles like network administrator, cloud network engineer, and data center technician. What do these jobs involve?

   A network administrator is a role which maintains and implements networking infrastructure for an organization. They will be working in both a data center as well as mapping and deploying other network equipment in a work space, either office or on a shop floor networking equipment.

   A cloud network engineer deals with setting up virtual networks on cloud providers.

   A data center technician performs similar duties to a regular network administrator, but in addition maintains the servers housed in the data center.

2. **How has the rise of cloud computing changed networking careers?**  
   Explore how companies like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud have centralized many networking functions.

   The cloud is just a fancy way to say "someone else's server". Cloud services have shifted physical infrastructure to a data center managed by another company, which reduces overall maintenance and cost to consumers. This has shifted role responsibilities for a network admin to more maintain virtual networking.

3. **Why are smaller organizations using hybrid cloud networks?**  
   Investigate how businesses combine on-premises infrastructure with cloud services, and what challenges they face.

   Smaller organizations are using a hybrid cloud to offload server hardware overhead to reduce the need for the organization to staff as many full time IT professionals. This results in lower overhead costs while simultaneously allowing the remaining IT professionals on staff to focus on other tasks.

4. **How do laws and regulations affect how networks are built?**  
   Search for examples of compliance requirements (like HIPAA or GDPR) that influence network design.

   Compliance laws can restrict network access, data encryption, and physical access. Segmented networks for restricted data is common, and physical access controls will also need a network connection.

5. **What impact is AI having on networking?**  
   Find out how automation, machine learning, and AI tools are changing how networks are monitored and managed.

   AI tools are very useful for generating code snippets and diagnosing config files. They are also good for analyzing network performance, and can help predict failures.
